## Overview

This project is a real-time tracking application built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. It leverages Leaflet for mapping and geolocation to track and display the position of users in real-time. The application is designed to provide an interactive map interface where users can see the live location updates of other users.

## Features

- **Real-time Location Tracking**: Continuously updates and displays the user's position on a map.
- **Interactive Map**: Uses Leaflet to provide a user-friendly and interactive map interface.
- **Geolocation Support**: Utilizes the browser's Geolocation API to get real-time location data.
- **Socket.io Integration**: Real-time communication between the server and clients using WebSockets.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for Node.js.
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/) - Embedded JavaScript templating engine.
